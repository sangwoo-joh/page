 Hi! I'm Sangwoo Joh. Currently I live in Seoul, where I work as a
 software engineer at Samsung Research. My professional work has
 focused on helping developers find and correct potential bugs easier
 and faster. To achive this goal, I've been involved a wide range of
 projects including static analysis tools, highly responsive backend
 systems, developer-friendly web APIs, and systems programming. <!--I
 completed my Master's degree of computer science and engineering at
 Seoul National University in 2018, and Bachelor's degree on the same
 major at KAIST in 2012. --> I'm interested in applied programming
 languages, including type systems, functional programming, garbage
 collections, and physical parallelism.
