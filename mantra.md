## An Old Hacker's Tips
 Stole this from

### The "Do It Anyway" Principle

> ... but sooner or later you will end up on some task or project that
> is difficult to accomplish and/or generally unpleasant, all due to
> factors outside of your control.

> .. would be the people that somehow got their tasks done anyway,
> even though there were ridiculous contstrains imposed by our
> environment issues that made it a lot harder.

> The brutal truth though is, ... We are all constantly measured in
> the eyes of our employers by what we actually deliver, and those who
> can find a way to succeed even in the face of adversity will always
> have an advantage over those who cannot, or do not want to.

### The "Two-And-Done" Rule

NOTE: I was really impressed by this rule. Keep this always in mind.

> It has to do with how to handle disagreements that come up at
> work.... have a pretty strong desire to always have the right answer
> to things, ... I would tenaciously argue my point, without letting
> go.

> ... I would let them know just why they were *wrong*, and why we
> needed to do it *my way* ... because something that I knew was
> better was being ignored.

> But this take-no-prisoners approach to debate **did not** do me any
> good... it would negatively impact my ability to affect change. If I
> did this too often, people would begin to see me as argumentative,
> difficult to work with, not a team player, ....

> .... I'm still a big fan of being right all the time, ... What's
> changed over the years though is first, an enhanced understanding
> that I in fact **am not right all the time**. But also that even
> when I am right, it isn't always a guarantee that others will
> **follow my advice**, and if they do not, that it's sill *OK*.

> ... I will state my case *the first time*, and if whoever is arguing
> to the contrary does not agree after hearing my position, I'll *let
> it go*. But the next time the opportunity comes up, I will argue my
> point *again*. Maybe allowing for a gap of time for people to
> consider my original point, or maybe allowing me time to refine and
> rephrase my ideas to be more convincing.

> If I fail to ... the second time though, **I am done.** .... "OK,
> let's go your way then. I still don't completely agree with
> everything proposed here, but I think I've made my case, and we ened
> to **move on**."

> Yielding in an argument like this has some weird, powerful
> effects. One is it kind of releases you from responsibility if
> things should go wrong. And if a truly bad decision has been made,
> it is actually pretty likely that things *wil* start going wrong. If
> you fail to convince people after two tries, you really do have to
> get behind the decision, and not try to sabotage or undermine it.

> ... it bumps up your personal brand, as someone who should maybe be
> listened to more often.
